## Concepts Covered

- **Basic Syntax**: Variables, data types, operators
- **Input/Output**: cin, cout, basic formatting
- **Control Flow**: if/else, for loops, while loops, switch
- **Functions**: Declaration, definition, parameters, return values
- **Arrays**: Declaration, initialization, iteration, searching
- **Strings**: Basic manipulation, character operations
- **Mathematical Operations**: Arithmetic, modulo, comparisons
- **Problem Solving**: Algorithm design, step-by-step thinking

## How to Use

1. Start with `01_hello_world.cpp` and work your way through numerically
2. Read the code comments to understand what each section does
3. Compile and run each program to see the output
4. Experiment by modifying values and adding features
5. Try to understand the logic before moving to the next project

## Compilation Instructions

For any project, use these commands:

### Windows (MinGW/Code::Blocks)
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o program.exe
program.exe
```

### Linux/macOS
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o program
./program
```

### Modern C++ Features Used
- Basic C++11 features (auto keyword where appropriate)
- Range-based for loops in later examples
- Simple STL usage (string, vector where necessary)

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Start Simple**: Don't rush through the early examples
2. **Experiment**: Modify the code to see what happens
3. **Debug**: Use cout statements to understand program flow
4. **Practice**: Try writing similar programs from scratch
5. **Ask Questions**: Each concept builds on previous ones

## Next Steps

After completing these projects, you'll be ready for the **Intermediate** directory, which covers:
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes and Objects)
- STL Containers and Algorithms
- File Input/Output
- Basic Templates
- Error Handling

Feel free to explore each project and modify the code to enhance your understanding!
