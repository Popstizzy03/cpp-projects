1. Introduction to C++
1.1 What is C++?
C++ is a high-performance, general-purpose programming language. It extends C with object-oriented programming (OOP) and generic programming features. Key applications include:

Operating Systems (Windows, Linux kernels)

Game Development (Unreal Engine, Unity plugins)

Embedded Systems (IoT devices, microcontrollers)

High-Frequency Trading (low-latency systems)

Desktop Applications (Adobe Suite, Chrome)

1.2 History of C++
1979: Bjarne Stroustrup creates "C with Classes."

1983: Renamed to C++.

1998: First ISO standard (C++98).

2011: Major update (C++11) introducing auto, lambdas, and smart pointers.

2020: C++20 adds concepts, ranges, and coroutines.

2023: C++23 (latest standard; partial compiler support).

1.3 Key Features of C++
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Organize code using classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Procedural Programming: Write functions sequentially (inherited from C).

Generic Programming: Use templates for type-agnostic code (e.g., std::vector<T>).

Direct Memory Control: Manage resources with pointers and manual memory allocation.

Standard Template Library (STL): Prebuilt data structures (e.g., vectors, maps) and algorithms (e.g., sorting).

Portability: Write once, compile anywhere (Windows, Linux, macOS).

2. Setting Up Your Environment
2.1 Installing a Compiler
A compiler translates human-readable code into machine instructions.

GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
Windows:

Install MinGW.

Add C:\MinGW\bin to your system PATH.

Linux:
sudo apt install g++  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install gcc-c++  # Fedora

macOS:
brew install gcc  # Using Homebrew

Clang
All OS: Download from llvm.org.

Android (Termux):
pkg install clang

2.2 Choosing an IDE/Text Editor
Tool	Platform	Best For
Visual Studio	Windows	Full-featured development
VS Code	Cross-platform	Lightweight customization
Xcode	macOS	Apple ecosystem
CLion	Cross-platform	Professional OOP projects
Configuring VS Code
Install the C/C++ Extension by Microsoft.

Set up tasks.json for compilation (auto-generated on first build).

2.3 Basic Workflow
Command Line (GCC)
Write code in hello.cpp:
   #include <iostream>  // Input/output stream library

int main() {  // Entry point of the program
    std::cout << "Hello, C++!" << std::endl;  // Print to console
    return 0;  // Exit status
}

Compile:
g++ hello.cpp -o hello  # -o specifies the output filename

Run:
./hello  # Linux/macOS
.\hello.exe  # Windows

IDE Workflow
Create a new project.

Write code in the editor.

Click Build (compiles code) â†’ Run (executes the program).

2.4 Troubleshooting
"Command not found": Ensure the compiler is installed and added to PATH.

Syntax Errors: Check for missing semicolons ; or typos.

Linker Errors: Include all required files during compilation (e.g., g++ file1.cpp file2.cpp).

3. Your First C++ Program
3.1 Code Breakdown
#include <iostream>: Imports the library for input/output operations.

int main(): Mandatory function where execution begins.

std::cout: "Character output" stream; << pipes data to the console.

std::endl: Ends the line and flushes the buffer.

3.2 Compiler Flags
Enhance your compilation with flags:

-Wall: Enable all warnings.

-std=c++20: Use the C++20 standard.
Example:
g++ -Wall -std=c++20 hello.cpp -o hello

4. Next Steps & Resources
Learning Roadmap
Basics: Variables, data types, operators.

Control Flow: if, switch, loops (for, while).

Functions: Parameter passing, recursion.

OOP: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism.

STL: Vectors, strings, algorithms.

Advanced: Templates, memory management, concurrency.
